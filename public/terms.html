      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <div class="legal-header__meta">Effective date: 1 January 2025 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 2026</div>
    </div>

    <div class="legal-callout">
      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a legally binding agreement between you ("you", "Customer") and <strong>Cove Platform Pty Ltd</strong> (ABN to be confirmed) ("Cove", "we", "us"). By creating an account or using the Cove platform, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use our services.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. The Service</h2>
    <p>Cove provides an automated SMS lead-qualification platform that enables small businesses to respond to missed calls and qualify inbound enquiries via SMS ("Service"). The Service includes a web-based dashboard, AI-generated SMS flows, dedicated Australian phone numbers, and related tools.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time with reasonable notice. We will endeavour to provide at least 14 days' notice of material changes.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
    <p>To use Cove, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be at least 18 years of age</li>
      <li>Be a legal entity or individual capable of entering a binding contract under Australian law</li>
      <li>Provide accurate and complete registration information</li>
      <li>Maintain the security of your account credentials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. If you suspect unauthorised access, notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:hello@coveplatform.com">hello@coveplatform.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use Cove only for lawful business purposes. You must not use the Service to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Send unsolicited commercial electronic messages (spam) in violation of the <em>Spam Act 2003</em> (Cth)</li>
      <li>Harass, threaten, or send abusive messages to any person</li>
      <li>Impersonate another person or business</li>
      <li>Send messages containing illegal content, including content that is defamatory, deceptive, or in breach of the <em>Australian Consumer Law</em></li>
      <li>Attempt to circumvent any security or rate-limiting measures of the platform</li>
      <li>Resell or sublicense the Service to third parties without our written consent</li>
      <li>Engage in any activity that could damage, disable, or impair the platform or our telephony infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Violation of these terms may result in immediate suspension or termination of your account.</p>

    <h2>4. Spam Act Compliance</h2>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The SMS messages sent through Cove are triggered only by inbound calls from your business number — recipients have initiated contact with your business and therefore have a relevant existing relationship</li>
      <li>You are responsible for ensuring all SMS communications sent via Cove comply with the <em>Spam Act 2003</em> (Cth) and any applicable telecommunications laws</li>
      <li>You must honour all opt-out requests immediately. Cove provides an automatic opt-out mechanism (STOP reply), but you must not attempt to override this</li>
      <li>You must not use Cove to send messages to purchased, rented, or third-party contact lists</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Plans and pricing</h3>
    <p>Cove is offered on a monthly subscription basis. Current pricing is displayed on our website. We reserve the right to change pricing with 30 days' written notice. Continued use after the effective date of a price change constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Free trial</h3>
    <p>We may offer a free trial period. Unless you cancel before the trial ends, your subscription will automatically commence and your payment method will be charged. No card is required to begin the trial on our self-serve plan.</p>

    <h3>5.3 Billing and payment</h3>
    <p>Subscriptions are billed monthly in Australian dollars (AUD) in advance. Payments are processed by our third-party payment provider. By providing payment details, you authorise us to charge the applicable subscription fee each billing period.</p>

    <h3>5.4 Taxes</h3>
    <p>All prices are inclusive of GST where applicable under the <em>A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999</em> (Cth).</p>

    <h2>6. Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
    <h3>6.1 Cancellation</h3>
    <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account dashboard or by contacting us. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. You retain access to the Service until the end of the paid period.</p>

    <h3>6.2 Money-back guarantee</h3>
    <p>We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for new subscribers. If you are not satisfied within the first 30 days of your first paid subscription, contact us and we will issue a full refund. This guarantee applies once per customer and does not apply to subsequent subscription periods.</p>

    <h3>6.3 Refunds outside the guarantee</h3>
    <p>Outside the 30-day guarantee, subscription fees are non-refundable unless required by law or at our sole discretion. This does not limit your rights under the <em>Australian Consumer Law</em>.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All intellectual property in the Cove platform, including software, design, trademarks, and content, is owned by or licensed to Cove Platform Pty Ltd. Nothing in these Terms transfers any intellectual property rights to you.</p>
    <p>You retain ownership of your business data, SMS flow configurations, and lead data. By using the Service, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive licence to process this data solely to provide the Service to you.</p>

    <h2>8. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our collection and use of personal information is governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. By using Cove, you agree to the Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge that the personal information of your leads (mobile phone numbers and SMS responses) is collected on your behalf. You are the data controller for your leads' personal information. You must ensure you have a lawful basis to engage with your leads via SMS.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law (including the <em>Australian Consumer Law</em>):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cove is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied</li>
      <li>We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that all leads will receive SMS messages (delivery depends on third-party telephony networks)</li>
      <li>Our total liability to you for any claim arising out of or in connection with the Service is limited to the subscription fees paid by you in the 3 months preceding the claim</li>
      <li>We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of revenue, loss of data, or loss of business opportunity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any right or remedy, or any guarantee, warranty, or other term or condition, implied or imposed by the <em>Australian Consumer Law</em> that cannot lawfully be excluded or limited, including any statutory guarantees as to acceptable quality.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Cove and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your breach of any applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Service integrates with third-party providers including telephony providers, payment processors, and AI services. Your use of these integrated services is subject to their own terms and policies. We are not responsible for the acts or omissions of third-party providers.</p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your account immediately if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You breach these Terms and fail to remedy the breach within 7 days of notice</li>
      <li>You use the Service for illegal or spam purposes</li>
      <li>We are required to do so by law or our telephony providers</li>
      <li>Your payment fails and is not remedied within 7 days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Upon termination, your access to the Service will cease. We will retain your data for the periods described in our Privacy Policy and then delete it.</p>

    <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>If a dispute arises between you and Cove, the parties agree to attempt to resolve it through good-faith negotiation before commencing formal proceedings.</p>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia. Each party submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria and the Federal Court of Australia.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email at least 14 days before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the Service after that date constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must cancel your subscription before the effective date.</p>

    <h2>15. General</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entire agreement:</strong> These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Cove regarding the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions continue in full force.</li>
      <li><strong>Waiver:</strong> A failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision.</li>
      <li><strong>No agency:</strong> Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between the parties.</li>
    </ul>
